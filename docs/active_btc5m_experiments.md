# Active BTC 5m Experiments

Last updated: 2026-05-29 08:38 BST (07:38 UTC).

Scope for this lane is BTC 5m only. Multi-market BTC/ETH and 15m/1h expansion is
paused until the BTC 5m engine has a clean full-history profile.

## Active Rerun

Current active rerun for path diagnostics:

- Run: `20260529T062901Z-portfolio-grid-5265`
- Label suffix: `cap1k_btc_5m_tail08_lc_range50_exact_profile_postpath_mem128_cf8`
- Instance: `i-069194bfa6e6aa332`
- Source commit: `40ac170edc295cf05b9311af27823ca03e423ad0`
- Purpose: rerun the selected BTC 5m profile with per-fill post-entry path
  telemetry (`adverse_excursion`, `crossed_mid_after_fill`, final side mid), so
  the reversal failure mode can be measured directly instead of inferred from
  final range buckets.

Latest checkpoint readout:

- S3 checkpoint analyzed: `7,750 / 23,705` markets.
- Checkpoint calendar: `2026-02-27T15:40:00Z` to `2026-03-26T13:25:00Z`.
- Checkpoint PnL: `+$5,336.70`; active markets `1,177 / 7,750`
  (`15.19%`).
- Path labels are present on all analyzed tracked lane fills.
- The failure mode is now clearly path-dependent, not just a final-range label:
  `crossed_mid_after_fill` is toxic, while held-side and moderate adverse paths
  are strongly profitable.
- `br2_late_favourite_load`: crossed-mid fills lost `-$2,739.40`; held-side
  fills made `+$2,858.32`; moderate-adverse fills made `+$1,139.26`.
- `br2_late_confirm`: crossed-mid fills lost `-$2,574.76`; held-side fills made
  `+$3,346.72`; moderate-adverse fills made `+$320.94`.
- `br2_high_skew_load`: crossed-mid fills lost `-$637.31`; held-side fills made
  `+$630.84`; moderate-adverse fills made `+$247.96`.
- Final-range `0.78..0.93` remains a useful post-hoc diagnostic bucket:
  late-favourite fills in that bucket lost `-$2,153.53`, while final range
  `<0.78` made `+$3,811.93`.
- Daily toxic-path evolution now confirms the actual negative-day mechanism:
  cross-mid PnL is a persistent drag even on profitable days, but it becomes
  account-level damage when non-crossing late breaks stop offsetting it. March
  12 lost `-$187.65` with `-$958.21` cross-mid PnL, March 13 lost `-$327.80`
  with `-$859.31` cross-mid PnL, and March 16 lost `-$224.84` with `-$820.01`
  cross-mid PnL. March 17 had cross-mid drag too (`-$253.60`) but finished
  `+$1,310.35` because non-cross paths made `+$1,563.95`.
- Replay-safe logistic path models on a final-10-day split remain diagnostic,
  not actionable gates. `toxic_reversal_path` test AUC is `0.5668`, log loss
  `0.7914`; `crossed_mid_after_fill` test AUC is `0.5901`, log loss `0.7476`.
  Both rank some path risk directionally, but high-risk test buckets still made
  money, so removing or hard-throttling the top buckets would delete profitable
  late breaks.
- Late-break feature contrast on `1,683` late-confirm/favourite fills shows why
  broad favourite throttles are wrong: toxic late breaks have lower average fill
  price (`0.7028`) and lower average model probability (`0.8081`) than
  profitable non-toxic late breaks (`0.7386` and `0.8375`). The highest-price
  and highest-model-probability quartiles are still profitable with lower toxic
  rates. The weak area is lower-confidence/lower-price late breaks plus certain
  prior-range bands, not simply large favourite exposure.
- The 5,750-market walk-forward gate simulation still has only one OOS fold with
  the current `500`-fill fold size. The best
  candidate was small (`br2_late_confirm:q0.95`, `+$35.29` full-removal
  improvement); broad/global throttles removed profitable fills. Treat this as
  a diagnostic signal only.
- A narrower late-break walk-forward gate search was added with train-side
  quantile thresholds. Candidate rules are admitted in a fold only when the same
  condition had negative train PnL. On the `7,750`-market checkpoint, the
  standard `900/300/300` split still favors `risk_score:q4 &
  prior_market_range_7d:q1`: `2` active OOS folds, `2` helpful, `0` harmful,
  removed `171` fills, removed PnL `-$236.11`, half-throttle improvement
  `+$118.05`. The sharper `side_model_p:q1 & side_edge_vs_fill:q2` candidate
  has only `1` active fold at this split but removed PnL `-$249.96` from just
  `29` fills, with removed toxic rate `51.72%` and cross-mid rate `62.07%`.
  Current read: the lower model-probability/mid-edge late-break slice is still
  the sharper research lead, but it needs more history and fold coverage before
  promotion.
- Portfolio/day half-throttle simulations were added on the `7,750`-market
  checkpoint. These convert candidate fill slices into base vs adjusted PnL and
  max-DD what-ifs, still using train-only thresholds. Results:
  - `side_model_p:q1 & side_edge_vs_fill:q2` (`600/200/200`): base PnL
    `+$5,336.70`, adjusted PnL `+$5,392.45`, adjustment `+$55.74`, max DD
    improves from `23.70%` to `18.23%`, but fold 5 was harmful (`-$206.47`
    half-throttle adjustment).
  - `risk_score:q4 & prior_market_range_7d:q1` (`900/300/300`): adjusted PnL
    `+$5,451.57`, adjustment `+$114.86`, max DD also `18.23%`, but it throttles
    many more markets (`144`) and hurts several strong days.
- The `7,750` portfolio what-ifs now include final-range bucket attribution.
  This is post-hoc only because resolved final range is not replay-safe, but it
  clarifies the shape: `risk_score:q4 & prior_market_range_7d:q1` helps wide
  (`+$329.30`) and extreme (`+$88.52`) resolved ranges while damaging
  mid-wide (`-$280.32`) ranges. The sharper `side_model_p:q1 &
  side_edge_vs_fill:q2` candidate is less invasive but still mixed: mid-wide
  `-$26.92`, wide `+$65.59`, extreme `+$17.07`. Current read: both remain
  diagnostics only; the live model should learn "late break that crosses back
  through mid" instead of gating late breaks or mid-wide markets broadly.
- Replay-safe hard-regime throttles were also tested in the same OOS fold
  (`expanded_not_decisive`, sign-flip/path-efficiency, observed-range/reversal,
  high-price choppy favourite variants). They all removed positive PnL in this
  checkpoint. That means the broad regime label is not enough; we need a sharper
  classifier for "late break that fails back through mid" rather than a blanket
  choppy/mid-wide throttle.

This checkpoint is not yet the final late-regime window. Do not promote a
post-fill reversal gate until the full-history artifact reaches the final 30d
slice and the OOS diagnostics are rerun there.

When the active artifact reaches the final 30d slice or completes, regenerate
the diagnostic pack with:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=visumlabs python3 scripts/run_postfill_diagnostics.py \
  s3://pm-research-backtest-prod/results/20260529T062901Z-portfolio-grid-5265/clip_0p015_gross_250_expfrac_0p12_lat500ms_cap1k_btc_5m_tail08_lc_range50_exact_profile_postpath_mem128_cf8/markets.jsonl \
  --aws-profile visumlabs \
  --recent-days 30 \
  --last-markets 8633 \
  --test-days 30 \
  --out-prefix docs/btc5m_postfill_full
```

This emits:

- `docs/btc5m_postfill_full_regime_evolution.md`
- `docs/btc5m_postfill_full_reversal_tail.md`
- `docs/btc5m_postfill_full_toxic_reversal_path_model.md`

- `docs/btc5m_postfill_full_late_break_gate_search.md`
- `docs/btc5m_postfill_full_late_break_gate_portfolio_sim.md`

To poll until the full artifact is ready and then run the same pack:

```bash

- Label:
  `clip_0p015_gross_250_expfrac_0p12_lat500ms_cap1k_btc_5m_tail08_lc_range50_exact_profile_mem128_cf8`
- Markets: `23,705`
- Equivalent 5m-market days: `82.31`
- Starting capital: `$1,000`
- Final PnL: `+$8,990.21`
- Return: `+899.02%`
- Implied compounded daily return: `2.836%`
- Max drawdown: `23.70%`
- Fills: `3,723`
- Active market rate: `8.50%`

  - `br2_high_skew_load`: `+$1,977.61`
  - `br2_convex_tail`: `-$93.83`

Reason for selection: the base profile beat the broader-tail cov75 variant on
full history, with slightly lower drawdown and materially less tail bleed. It
keeps cheap 8c convex tails enabled without paying for the heavier cov75
coverage budget that did not improve drawdown or final PnL on this history.

Rejected comparator:
`cap1k_btc_5m_tail08_cov75_ladder_lc_range50_exact_profile_mem128_cf8`

- Markets: `23,705`
- Final PnL: `+$8,969.77`
- Return: `+896.98%`
- Implied compounded daily return: `2.833%`
- Max drawdown: `23.72%`

  - `br2_high_skew_load`: `+$1,979.40`
  - `br2_convex_tail`: `-$130.06`

Selection status: chosen. Do not launch additional broad grids for this lane
unless new data, live/paper fill evidence, or a specific failure mode justifies
another narrow test.

## Previous Leading Checkpoints

These were strong but incomplete checkpoints before the memory-safe full-history
relaunches:

1. `cap1k_btc_5m_tail08_lc_range50_exact_profile`
   - Run: `20260528T211443Z-portfolio-grid-55343`
   - Markets: `12,250`
   - PnL: `+$7,121.84`
   - Return: `+712.18%`
   - Max drawdown: `23.70%`
2. `cap3k_btc_5m_tail08_lc_range50_exact_profile`

   - Return: `+326.86%`
   - Max drawdown: `17.94%`

## Completed Full-History Relaunches

The earlier exact-profile runners did not finish the `23,705`-market history.
SSM/systemd showed `cloud-final.service` failed with `Result: oom-kill`, and
the `pm-app` process was killed after the local run logs reached about
`12,500 / 23,705` markets. The durable S3 summaries are still valid up to their
last uploaded checkpoints, but those runs should not be treated as complete.

Idle OOM-killed instances terminated to control cost:

- `i-026438638670e3522` (`1K` exact profile)
- `i-0b97808c7b58a5dda` (`3K` exact profile)
- `i-0261b49082277a123` (`5K` exact profile)

The smaller coverage runner also became stale with pending SSM commands and no
new S3 checkpoint beyond `3,500` markets, so it was terminated:

- `i-04582d750613706e2`

Completed memory-safe full-history candidates:

1. Base 1K exact tail08 profile
   - Run: `20260528T225810Z-portfolio-grid-52322`
   - Label:
     `clip_0p015_gross_250_expfrac_0p12_lat500ms_cap1k_btc_5m_tail08_lc_range50_exact_profile_mem128_cf8`
   - Instance: `i-03916a47348b6d96b`
   - Instance type: `r7i.4xlarge`
   - Memory-safety change: `max_concurrent_fetches = 8`, larger memory host.
   - Strategy logic: same 1K exact profile and frozen meta-calibrator.
   - Final status: completed all `23,705` markets and self-terminated.
   - Final result: `+$8,990.21`, max drawdown `23.70%`, `3,723` fills.
2. Broader tail-coverage variant
   - Run: `20260528T225904Z-portfolio-grid-53933`
   - Label:
     `clip_0p015_gross_250_expfrac_0p12_lat500ms_cap1k_btc_5m_tail08_cov75_ladder_lc_range50_exact_profile_mem128_cf8`
   - Instance: `i-0e76ad30421811c0d`
   - Instance type: `r7i.4xlarge`
   - Memory-safety change: `max_concurrent_fetches = 8`, larger memory host.
   - Strategy logic: same exact profile except broader tail coverage:
     `target_favourite_loss_coverage_frac = 0.75`, `tail_max_clips = 10`,
     `tail_min_skew_step = 0.01`, `tail_extreme_threshold = 0.25`,
     `budget_favourite_spend_frac = 0.30`, and
     `budget_favourite_upside_frac = 0.40`.
   - Final status: completed all `23,705` markets and self-terminated.
   - Final result: `+$8,969.77`, max drawdown `23.72%`, `3,731` fills.

Common-prefix read: cov75 had a small early lead, but the base profile overtook
it after the larger drawdown/recovery section. On the full history, base finished
`$20.44` ahead with slightly lower drawdown and `$36.23` less tail bleed. The
extra cov75 insurance improved tail payoff in the few tail-hit markets, but did
not improve portfolio-level drawdown or final PnL.

## Tail Hedge Readout

Final full-history base tail08 readout:

- Tail fills: `174`
- Tail markets: `173`
- Gross tail premium spent: `$382.66`
- Tail payout: `$288.83`
- Net tail PnL: `-$93.83`
- Tail shares: `6,131.84`
- Average tail fill price: `6.2c`
- Tail wins: `11 / 174`, `6.32%`
- Directional non-tail notional: about `$173.6k`
- Tail premium as share of directional non-tail notional: about `0.22%`
- Main loss in markets where a tail was present and hit: `$589.20`
- Tail profit in those same markets: `$270.80`
- Tail coverage in those hit markets: `45.96%` net, `49.02%` payout.

Final full-history cov75 readout:

- Tail fills: `183`
- Tail markets: `176`
- Gross tail premium spent: `$565.51`
- Tail payout: `$435.45`
- Net tail PnL: `-$130.06`
- Tail shares: `9,124.35`
- Average tail fill price: `6.2c`
- Tail wins: `12 / 183`, `6.56%`
- Main loss in markets where a tail was present and hit: `$641.62`
- Tail profit in those same markets: `$408.07`
- Tail coverage in those hit markets: `63.60%` net, `67.87%` payout.

Interpretation: tails are working as cheap convexity when they hit, but the
current tail budget is too small and sparse to be a full portfolio hedge. The
selected base profile keeps the cheaper convexity lane because it loses less
premium while preserving most of the full-run PnL. A future live/paper variant
can revisit broader tail participation, but cov75 did not earn promotion on this
historical pass.
